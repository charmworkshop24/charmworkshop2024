            <p class="title">Preparing for Extreme Heterogeneity in High Performance Computing</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Jeffrey S. Vetter, Oak Ridge National Laboratory</p>
            <p>While computing technologies have remained relatively stable for nearly two decades, new architectural
                features, such as heterogeneous cores, deep memory hierarchies, non-volatile memory (NVM), and
                near-memory processing, have emerged as possible solutions to address the concerns of energy-efficiency
                and cost. However, we expect this 'golden age' of architectural change to lead to extreme heterogeneity
                and it will have a major impact on software systems and applications. Software will need to be
                redesigned to exploit these new capabilities and provide some level of performance portability across
                these diverse architectures. In this talk, I will survey these emerging technologies, discuss their
                architectural and software implications, and describe several new approaches (e.g., domain specific
                languages, intelligent runtime systems) to address these challenges.</p>

            <p class="title">Asynchronous Programming in Modern C++</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Hartmut Kaiser, Louisiana State University</p>
            <p>With the advent of modern computer architectures characterized by many-core nodes, deep and complex
                memory hierarchies, heterogeneous subsystems, and power-aware components, it is becoming increasingly
                difficult to achieve best possible application scalability and satisfactory parallel efficiency. The
                community is experimenting with new programming models that rely on finer-grain parallelism, flexible
                and lightweight synchronization, combined with work-queue-based, message-driven computation. The
                recently growing interest in the C++ programming language increases the demand for libraries
                implementing those programming models for the language. We present a new asynchronous C++ parallel
                programming model that is built around lightweight tasks and mechanisms to orchestrate massively
                parallel and distributed execution. This model uses the concept of Futures to make data dependencies
                explicit, employs explicit and implicit asynchrony to hide latencies and to improve utilization, and
                manages finer-grain parallelism with a work-stealing scheduling system enabling automatic load balancing
                of tasks. We have developed and implemented such a model as a C++ library exposing a higher-level
                parallelism API that is fully conforming to the existing C++11/14/17 standards and is aligned with the
                ongoing standardization work. This API and programming model has shown to enable writing highly
                efficient parallel applications for heterogeneous resources with excellent performance and scaling
                characteristics.</p>

            <p class="title">Towards Performance Tools for Emerging GPU-Accelerated Exascale Supercomputers</p>
            <p class="subtitle">John Mellor-Crummey, Rice University</p>
            <p>To tune applications for emerging exascale supercomputers, application developers need tools that measure
                the performance of applications on GPU-accelerated platforms and attribute application performance back
                to program source code. This talk will describe work in progress developing extensions to Rice
                University's HPCToolkit performance tools to support measurement and analysis of GPU-accelerated
                applications on current supercomputers based on NVIDIA GPUs and forthcoming exascale systems based on
                AMD and Intel GPUs. At present, HPCToolkit's support for NVIDIA's GPUs is the most mature. To help
                developers understand the performance of accelerated applications as a whole, HPCToolkit's measurement
                and analysis tools attribute metrics to calling contexts that span both CPUs and GPUs. HPCToolkit
                measures both profiles and traces of GPU execution. To measure GPU-accelerated applications efficiently,
                HPCToolkit employs novel wait-free data structures to coordinate monitoring and attribution of GPU
                performance metrics. To help developers understand the performance of complex GPU code generated from
                high-level template-based programming models, HPCToolkit's hpcprof constructs sophisticated
                approximations of call path profiles for GPU computations. To support fine-grain analysis and tuning,
                HPCToolkit uses platform-dependent hardware and software measurement capabilities to attribute GPU
                performance metrics to source lines and loops. We illustrate HPCToolkit's emerging capabilities for
                analyzing GPU-accelerated applications with several case studies.</p>

            <p id="talk_choi" class="title">Achieving Computation-Communication Overlap with Overdecomposition on GPU
                Systems</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Jaemin Choi, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</p>
            <p>The landscape of high performance computing is
                shifting towards a collection of multi-GPU nodes, widening
                the gap between on-node compute and off-node communication
                capabilities. Consequently, the ability to tolerate communication
                latencies and maximize utilization of the compute hardware are
                becoming increasingly important in achieving high performance.
                Overdecomposition, which enables a logical decomposition of the
                problem domain without being constrained by the number of
                processors, has been successfully adopted on traditional CPU-based
                systems to achieve computation-communication overlap,
                significantly reducing the impact of communication on performance.
                However, it has been unclear whether overdecomposition
                can provide the same benefits on modern GPU systems, especially
                given the perceived overheads associated with smaller kernels
                that overdecomposition entails. In this work, we address the challenges
                in applying overdecomposition to GPU-accelerated applications
                and ensuring asynchronous progress of GPU operations
                using the Charm++ parallel programming system. Combining
                prioritization of communication in the application and support
                for asynchronous progress in the runtime system, we obtain
                improvements in overall performance of up to 50% and 47%
                with proxy applications Jacobi3D and MiniMD, respectively.</p>

            <p id="talk_buch" class="title">Vector Load Balancing in Charm++</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Ronak Buch, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</p>
            <p>Load balancing has been a fundamental tenet of Charm++ for a long while, but it has been limited in the
                amount of data available to it. Recently, we have added support for vector load balancing, a scheme in
                which the runtime system and/or the user record multiple load metrics (e.g. recording separate,
                orthogonal phases of execution or CPU and GPU load). This enables the load balancing system to make more
                precise adjustments of objects and improve the quality of its placement decisions. Doing so has required
                an overhaul of the load balancing infrastructure, APIs, and strategies in Charm++, which we will
                discuss.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Philip Chang, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee<br>Zachariah Etienne, West Virginia
                University</p>
            <p>Moving-mesh hydrodynamics has changed the face of numerical simulation of galaxies and structure
                formation over the last 10 years. In this talk, I discuss the design and construction of moving-mesh
                hydrodynamic algorithms as applied to dynamical stellar problems. In particular, I will briefly describe
                the construction of Voronoi meshes and the application of unstructured moving-meshes to solving
                flux-conservative equations and the challenges to strong scalability. I will also very briefly describe
                recent results obtained by my group using the MANGA code, the moving-mesh hydrodynamics solver for
                ChaNGa. I will discuss results obtained for common-envelope evolution and tidal disruption events. I
                will close with brief discussion of the extension of these moving-mesh algorithms toward general
                relativistic hydrodynamics with an eye toward moving-mesh NS-NS and NS-BH simulations.</p>

            <p id="talk_martyna" class="title">Projector Augmented Wave based Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory
                Simulations with Reduced Order Scaling</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Glenn Martyna, Pimpernel Science, Software and Information Technology</p>
            <p>Currently, our massively parallel implementation of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT)
                implemented in the OpenAtom software under Charm++ employs norm-conserving non-local pseudopotentials to
                describe the electron-ion interactions. While sufficient to examine many interesting systems of
                technological and scientific interest, it cannot address the electronic properties of heavy elements
                such as iron and copper efficiently due to the requirement of a large basis set or equivalently a large
                plane-wave cutoff to describe the electronic states. The Projector Augmented Wave approach (PAW) in
                contrast has many important features such as: (1) less demanding plane-wave cutoff energy due to the
                splitting of delocalized and core parts of the electron wavefunctions and (2) direct access to the
                core-states if needed for NMR and other related responses. However, traditional PAW based KS-DFT scales
                as ~N3 and the parallel performance is quite poor. To solve this problem, we developed a PAW based
                KS-DFT in OpenAtom with ~N2logN scaling enabled by Euler Exponential Spline (EES) and FFTs to form a 4
                grid multi-resolution method. We increase the accuracy of the long-range interactions by applying Ewald
                summation methods to the Hartree and external interactions. Our development inherits all the merits of
                the PAW method with significantly higher efficiency and builds naturally on our previous charm++
                implementation.</p>

            <p id="talk_pandare" class="title">Asynchronous Distributed-Memory Task-Parallel Algorithm for Compressible
                Flows on 3D Unstructured Grids</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Jozsef Bakosi, Los Alamos National Laboratory<br>Marc Charest, Los Alamos National
                Laboratory<br>Aditya Pandare, Los Alamos National Laboratory<br>Jacob Waltz, Los Alamos National
                Laboratory</p>
            <p>We discuss the implementation of a finite element method, used to numerically solve the Euler equations
                of compressible flows, using an asynchronous runtime system (RTS). The algorithm is implemented for
                distributed-memory machines, using unstructured 3D meshes, combining data-, and task-parallelism on top
                of the Charm++ RTS. Charm++'s execution model is asynchronous by default, allowing arbitrary overlap of
                computation and communication. Task-parallelism allows scheduling parts of an algorithm independently
                of, or dependent on, each other. Built-in automatic load balancing enables continuous redistribution of
                computational load by migration of work units based on real-time CPU load measurement. The RTS also
                features automatic checkpointing, fault tolerance, resilience against hardware failures, and supports
                power-, and energy-aware computation. We demonstrate scalability up to O(10^9) cells at O(10^4) compute
                cores and the benefits of automatic load balancing for irregular workloads. The full source code with

                use overset unstructured mesh methods to compute structural mechanics of solids interacting with
                compressible fluids within complex 3D geometries. To couple fluid and solid mechanics solvers, we are

            <p>OpenAtom is an open-source, massively parallel software application that performs ab initio molecular
                dynamics simulations and ground and excited states calculations utilizing a planewave basis set and
                relies on the charm++ runtime system. We describe the status of the excited-state GW implementation in
                OpenAtom: the GW method is an accurate but computationally expensive method for describing dynamics of
                excited electrons in solid state systems. We briefly describe the current O(N^4) scaling GW method
                implemented in the public version of OpenAtom (where N is the number of atoms in the simulation cell).
                We then present our progress in implementing an O(N^3) scaling GW method in OpenAtom. In addition to the
                formalism and physical principles, our parallelization method and scaling results will be presented.</p>

            <p>Charj, a general-purpose language for parallel computing based on Charm++, has had many advances since it
                was last discussed at the Charm++ workshop. Its most recent iteration of the language has a Scala-like

                embedded domain-specific languages for orchestration (i.e. Charisma) and the Multiphase Shared Arrays

            Enzo-E is an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) astrophysics and cosmology application, and Cello is the AMR
            framework on which Enzo-E is built. Enzo-E supports an increasingly rich collection of physics kernels,
            including hydrodynamics, self-gravity, cosmological expansion, chemistry and cooling, and
            magnetohydrodynamics. Enzo-E's physics kernels are implemented on top of Cello's fully-distributed
            array-of-octree AMR hierarchy, which is in turn represented using a Charm++ chare array of blocks. We are
            currently in the final stages of implementing and testing the last functionality required to run large-scale
            cosmological structure formation simulations that include both dark matter and baryonic matter. These latest
            features include scalable gravity, robust ghost-zone refresh, flux-correction, and improved interpolation.
            After the last of these is completed, Enzo-E/Cello will begin its production phase, running scientifically
            viable astrophysics and cosmology simulations on some of the largest HPC platforms available today.

            <p>We present the execution model of Virtual Transport (VT) a new, Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) runtime
                system that provides unprecedented integration and interoperability with MPI. We have developed VT in
                conjunction with large production applications to provide a highly incremental, high-value path to AMT
                adoption in the dominant ecosystem of MPI applications, libraries, and developers. Our aim is that the
                'MPI+X' model of hybrid parallelism can smoothly extend to become 'MPI+VT +X'. We illustrate a set of
                design and implementation techniques that have been useful in building VT. We believe that these ideas
                and the code embodying them will be useful to others building similar systems, and perhaps provide
                insight to how MPI might evolve to better support them. We motivate our approach with two applications

            <p>Performance analysis is critical for eliminating scalability bottlenecks in parallel codes. There are
                many profiling tools that can instrument codes and gather performance data. However, analytics and
                visualization tools that are general, easy to use, and programmable are limited. In this talk, we focus
                on the analytics of structured profiling data, such as that obtained from calling context trees or
                nested region timers in code. We present a set of techniques and operations that build on the pandas
                data analysis library to enable analysis of parallel profiles. We have implemented these techniques in a
                Python-based library called Hatchet that allows structured data to be filtered, aggregated, and pruned.
                Using performance datasets obtained from profiling parallel codes, we demonstrate performing common
                performance analysis tasks reproducibly with a few lines of Hatchet code. Hatchet brings the power of
                modern data science tools to bear on performance analysis.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Francois Hebert, Caltech</p>
            <p>Recent groundbreaking observations have led to a new era for the study of black holes and neutron stars.
                The Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories have measured gravitational waves from
                merging pairs of black holes and neutron stars, proving that these systems exist in nature and enabling
                us to study them in detail. The Event Horizon Telescope has directly imaged the accretion flows around
                the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, giving us a new look into these extreme
                environments. To interpret these observations, however, we rely on simulations to bridge the gap between
                the highly non-linear governing physics equations and the signals seen in our instruments. Improving the
                accuracy of simulation methods, as well as their parallelization on large future supercomputers, will be
                a step key to improving the science output from future observations.</p>
            <p>SpECTRE is a next-generation multi-physics code implemented using Charm++, designed to improve on the
                accuracy and scaling limitations of current codes in relativistic astrophysics. SpECTRE solves the
                governing equations --general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics for the matter and/or Einstein's
                equations for dynamical spacetimes-- using a discontinuous Galerkin method. The DG method provides the
                accuracy of high-order spectral-type methods where the solution is smooth, with various robust
                shock-capturing methods available near discontinuities (e.g., shocks in the matter). SpECTRE uses
                task-based parallelism implemented using Charm++, and gets excellent scaling to hundreds of thousands of
                processors.</p>
            <p>In this talk, I will provide an overview of SpECTRE and the algorithms we've implemented. I will give an
                update on our progress toward simulating binary black hole mergers, highlighting a simulation of the
                initial "inspiral" phase of the evolution before the black holes merge. I will present our initial
                investigations into load-balancing and checkpoint-restarting using Charm++'s built-in features,
                highlighting successes and challenges we've faced and features we would like to see in Charm++. Finally,

                CNRS<br>Johanne Cohen, Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Univ. Paris-Sud - CNRS</p>
            <p>In this talk, we discuss some of our recent work on the subject of distributed scheduling algorithms for
                high-performance computing applications.
                We have detected that distributed scheduling algorithms are not very commonly found in contemporaneous
                runtime systems, whereas many more scheduling algorithms are found in the literature.
                These distributed scheduling algorithms are usually based on simple models using little to no
                information, which leads to scenarios which are far from what are able to achieve in our runtime
                systems.
                We present some of our initial steps on the adaptation of a distributed scheduling algorithm to use
                basic global information (the average resource load) and we detail simulation experiments that point to
                the next steps.
                We finish this talk by discussing the importance of reducing the need or requirements for experimental

            <p>In this work we develop two broad techniques for improving the performance of graph traversals and
                general parallel algorithms.
                1. Bounded Asynchrony. Increasing asynchrony in a bounded manner allows one to avoid costly global syn-
                chronization at scale, while still avoiding the penalty of unbounded asynchrony including redundant
                work. In addition, asynchronous processing enables a new family of approximate algorithms when
                applications are tolerant to a fixed amount of error.
                2. Nested parallelism. Allowing to express graph algo- rithms in a naturally nested parallel manner
                enables us to fully exploit all of the available parallelism inherent in graph algorithms.</p>

                regional rainfall, wind, atmospheric pressure, wave-induced set up, wave runup, tides, and fluctuating
                baseline ocean water levels. Operational storm surge models such as NOAAâ€™s ESTOFS incorporate a
                variety of these processes including riverine discharges, atmospheric winds and pressure, waves, and
                tides. However, coastal surge models do not typically incorporate the impact of rainfall across the
                coastal flood-plain nor fluctuations in background water levels due to the oceanic density structure.
                Efficient simulation of these phenomena is challenging due to the dynamic load imbalance associated with
                fluctuating water levels. This talk will review the science of accurately simulating these scenarios and

            <p>We demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the techniques of overdecomposition and work-sharing to
                improve application performance. Our key insight is that tuning these two parameters in combination
                optimizes performance by facilitating the trade off of communication overlap and overhead. We explore
                this new space of potential optimization by varying both the problem size decomposition (grain size) and
                number of cores assigned to execute a particular task (spreading). Utilizing these two variables in
                concert, we can shape the execution timeline of applications in order to more smoothly inject messages
                on the network, improve cache performance, and decrease the overall execution time of an application. As
                single-node performance continues to outpace network bandwidth, ensuring smooth and continuous injection
                of messages into the network will continue to be of crucial importance. Our preliminary results
                demonstrate a greater than two-fold improvement in performance over a naive OpenMP-only baseline and a

                Illinois Urbana-Champaign</p>
            <p>NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance
                simulation of large biomolecular systems. Given the diverse features and
                methodologies available in NAMD, it is considered in the eld to be a major
                biomolecular simulation engine, used by around 20,000 users, with many running
                the code at various supercomputing facilities, including DOE and XSEDE
                resources. NAMD is one of the premier Charm++ applications, and has been
                developed in conjunction with Charm++ since the mid-90s. NAMD is also
                the rst full-featured molecular dynamics code to adopt CUDA acceleration
                for scaling on NVIDIA GPUs. Development eorts in both NAMD and
                Charm++ have enabled scaling on heterogeneous architectures, most notably
                on the ORNL Summit supercomputer.
                In spite of the eorts taken to improve performance and scaling of NAMD
                on Summit by ooading the force calculations to GPU, performance is limited
                by the remaining CPU calculations required for time stepping. The overlap
                between CPU and GPU calculations, that used to benet NAMD on earlier
                CUDA-capable GPUs, became imbalanced as subsequent generation GPU performance
                outpaced that of CPUs, making NAMD performance CPU-bound,
                an eect that is exacerbated by multi-GPU nodes with fewer CPU cores dedicated
                to each GPU. Development eorts over the past two years have improved
                NAMD performance on GPUs by moving the remaining CPU work for each
                time step to the GPU while reducing host-device memory transfers, changing
                NAMD from employing a GPU-ooad strategy to a GPU-resident one, in which
                data is maintained on the GPU across time steps. The result has been released
                as NAMD version 3.0, featuring a fast single-GPU code path that doubles performance
                by more fully utilizing the GPU with very little calculation remaining
                on the CPU. This new simulation modality can be used together with the existing
                multiple copy framework to scale smaller system sizes (under 1M atoms)
                across all available GPUs in a parallel computer to achieve very large amounts
                of aggregate sampling. Recent work, not yet available as production-quality
                code, has succeeded in extending the single-GPU implementation to scale to
                multiple GPUs on a single node.
                There are important challenges to overcome in order to realize a scalable
                GPU-resident version of NAMD. The PME (particle mesh Ewald) algorithm
                for approximating long-range electrostatics poses an immediate issue for multi-
                GPU scaling. The 3D FFTs are too small to parallelize eectively across multiple
                GPUs, either through the use of direct multi-GPU support in cuFFT or
                the manual assignment of pencils to GPUs along each dimension. The best alternative
                for supporting PME appears to be assigning the FFTs together with
                the reciprocal space calculation to a single GPU, which requires sending all
                grid data to a designated GPU while taking care to not overload it. A better
                approach appears to be replacing PME with the MSM (multilevel summation
                method) an alternative algorithm yielding a similar approximation. The
                hierarchical nature of the MSM calculation produces a scalable tree-like communication
                structure with nearest neighbor communication at each level, much
                like the well known FMM (fast multipole method). New theoretical development
                reveals that the MSM can achieve the same order of accuracy as PME
                through the use of periodic B-spline basis functions, while relegating the 3D
                FFTs and reciprocal space calculation to the coarsest grid level, thus allowing
                the FFT to be made as small as desired.
                Another important challenge is how to reintroduce Charm++ eectively
                into a GPU-resident NAMD for multi-node scaling. The current single-GPU
                implementation side-steps NAMD's current Charm++ infrastructure, avoiding
                extra latency by putting unused user-level threads to sleep. It might be possible
                to employ the new Charm++ GPU direct messaging API to minimize CPU
                involvement.
