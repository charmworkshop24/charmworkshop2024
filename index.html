            <p class="h4"><strong>The Charm++ Workshop</strong></p>
            The workshop is broadly focused on adaptivity in highly scalable
            parallel computing. It also takes stock of recent results in
            adaptive runtime techniques in Charm++ and the collaborative
            interdisciplinary research projects developed using it.

              >Charm++</a
            >
            is a C++ based parallel programming system based on an introspective
            adaptive runtime system, with many features suitable for addressing
            upcoming extreme scale as well as mid-scale challenges, and with
            multiple highly scalable parallel applications such as NAMD, ChaNGa,
            and OpenAtom. <br /><br />
            Our group's goal is to develop technology that improves performance
            of parallel applications while also improving programmer
            productivity. We aim to reach a point where, with our freely
            distributed software base, complex irregular and dynamic
            applications can (a) be developed quickly and (b) perform scalably
            on machines with thousands of processors.

          </p>

          <p class="text-light" style="font-size: small">
            A real-world challenge in data science is to develop interactive
            methods for quickly analyzing new and novel data sets that are
            potentially of massive scale. In this talk, Bader will discuss his
            development of graph algorithms in the context of Arkouda, an
            open-source NumPy-like replacement for interactive data science on
            tens of terabytes of data. Massive-scale analytics is an emerging
            field that integrates the power of high-performance computing and
            mathematical modeling to extract key insights and information from
            large-scale data sets. Productivity in massive-scale analytics
            entails quick interpretation of results through easy-to-use
            frameworks, while also adhering to design principles that combine
            high-performance computing and user-friendly simplicity. However,
            data scientists often encounter challenges, especially with graph
            analytics, which require the analysis of complex data from various
            domains, such as the cybersecurity, natural and social sciences. To
            address this issue, we introduce Arachne, an open-source framework
            that enhances accessibility and usability in massive-scale graph
            analytics. Arachne offers novel algorithms and implementations of
            graph kernels for efficient data analysis, such as connected
            components, breadth-first search, triangle counting, k-truss, among
            others. The high-performance algorithms are integrated into a
            back-end server written in HPE/Cray’s Chapel language and can be
            accessed through a Python application programming interface (API).
            Arachne’s back-end server is compatible with Linux supercomputers,
            is easy to set up, and can be utilized through either Python scripts
            or Jupyter notebooks, which makes it a desirable tool for data
            scientists who have access to high performance computers. In this
            talk, Bader presents an overview of the algorithms his research
            group has implemented into Arachne and, if applicable, the
            algorithmic innovations of each. Further, Bader will discuss
            improvements to our graph data structure to store extra information
            such as node labels, edge relationships, and node and edge
            properties. Arachne is built as an extension to the open-source
            Arkouda framework and allows for graphs to be generated from Arkouda
            dataframes. The open-source code for Arachne can be found at
            https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit. This is joint work with
            Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez, Zhihui Du, Joseph Patchett, Naren
            Khatwani, Fuhuan Li, Bader is supported in part by the National
            Science Foundation award CCF-2109988.

              In 1998, Bader built the first Linux supercomputer that led to a
              high-performance computing (HPC) revolution, and Hyperion Research
              estimates that the total economic value of Linux supercomputing
              pioneered by Bader has been over $100 trillion over the past 25
              years. The Computer History Museum recogizes Bader for developing
              the first Linux-based supercomputer which became the predominant
              architecture for all major supercomputers in the world. Bader is a
              cofounder of the Graph500 List for benchmarking “Big Data”
              computing platforms. He is recognized as a “RockStar” of High
