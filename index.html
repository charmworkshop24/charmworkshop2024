          <p class="display-4"><strong>The Charm++ Ecosystem</strong></p>
          <p class="text-dark">
            Charm++ is a C++ based parallel programming system based on an
            introspective adaptive runtime system, with many features suitable
            for addressing upcoming extreme scale as well as mid-scale
            challenges, and with multiple highly scalable parallel applications
            such as NAMD, ChaNGa, and OpenAtom.
            <br /><br />
            Our group's goal is to develop technology that improves performance
            of parallel applications while also improving programmer
            productivity. We aim to reach a point where, with our freely
            distributed software base, complex irregular and dynamic
            applications can (a) be developed quickly and (b) perform scalably
            on machines with thousands of processors.

                Jeffrey Vetter, Ph.D., is a Corporate Fellow at Oak Ridge
                National Laboratory (ORNL). At ORNL, he is currently the Section
                Head for Advanced Computer Systems Research and the founding
                director of the Experimental Computing Laboratory (ExCL).
                Previously, Vetter was the founding group leader of the Future
                Technologies Group in the Computer Science and Mathematics
                Division from 2003 until 2020. Vetter earned his Ph.D. in
                Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology.
                Vetter is a Fellow of the IEEE, and a Distinguished Scientist
                Member of the ACM. In 2010, Vetter, as part of an
                interdisciplinary team from Georgia Tech, NYU, and ORNL, was
                awarded the ACM Gordon Bell Prize. In 2015, Vetter served as the
                SC15 Technical Program Chair. His recent books, entitled
                "Contemporary High Performance Computing: From Petascale toward
                Exascale (Vols. 1 and 2)," survey the international landscape of
                HPC. Learn more information at

            Preparing for Extreme Heterogeneity in High Performance Computing
          </p>
          <br />
          While computing technologies have remained relatively stable for
          nearly two decades, new architectural features, such as heterogeneous
          cores, deep memory hierarchies, non-volatile memory (NVM), and
          near-memory processing, have emerged as possible solutions to address
          the concerns of energy-efficiency and cost. However, we expect this
          'golden age' of architectural change to lead to extreme heterogeneity
          and it will have a major impact on software systems and applications.
          Software will need to be redesigned to exploit these new capabilities
          and provide some level of performance portability across these diverse
          architectures. In this talk, I will survey these emerging
          technologies, discuss their architectural and software implications,
          and describe several new approaches (e.g., domain specific languages,
          intelligent runtime systems) to address these challenges.

                Hartmut is a member of the faculty at the CS department at
                Louisiana State University (LSU) and a senior research scientist
                at LSU's Center for Computation and Technology (CCT). He
                received his doctorate from the Technical University of Chemnitz
                (Germany). He is probably best known through his involvement in
                open source software projects, mainly as the author of several
                C++ libraries he has contributed to Boost, which are in use by
                C++ thousands of developers worldwide. He is a voting member of
                the ISO C++ Standardization Committee. His current research is
                focused on leading the STE||AR group at CCT working on the
                practical design and implementation of future execution models
                and programming abstractions. His research interests are focused
                on the complex interaction of compiler technologies, runtime
                systems, active libraries, and modern system's architectures.
                His goal is to enable the creation of a new generation of
                scientific applications in powerful, though complex
                environments, such as high performance computing, distributed
                computing, many task runtime systems, and compiler technologies.

            Asynchronous Programming in Modern C++
          </p>
          <br />
          With the advent of modern computer architectures characterized by
          many-core nodes, deep and complex memory hierarchies, heterogeneous
          subsystems, and power-aware components, it is becoming increasingly
          difficult to achieve best possible application scalability and
          satisfactory parallel efficiency. The community is experimenting with
          new programming models that rely on finer-grain parallelism, flexible
          and lightweight synchronization, combined with work-queue-based,
          message-driven computation. The recently growing interest in the C++
          programming language increases the demand for libraries implementing
          those programming models for the language. We present a new
          asynchronous C++ parallel programming model that is built around
          lightweight tasks and mechanisms to orchestrate massively parallel and
          distributed execution. This model uses the concept of Futures to make
          data dependencies explicit, employs explicit and implicit asynchrony
          to hide latencies and to improve utilization, and manages finer-grain
          parallelism with a work-stealing scheduling system enabling automatic
          load balancing of tasks. We have developed and implemented such a
          model as a C++ library exposing a higher-level parallelism API that is
          fully conforming to the existing C++11/14/17 standards and is aligned
          with the ongoing standardization work. This API and programming model
          has shown to enable writing highly efficient parallel applications for
          heterogeneous resources with excellent performance and scaling
          characteristics.

            Towards Performance Tools for Emerging GPU-Accelerated Exascale
            Supercomputers
          </p>
          <br />
          To tune applications for emerging exascale supercomputers, application
          developers need tools that measure the performance of applications on
          GPU-accelerated platforms and attribute application performance back
          to program source code. This talk will describe work in progress
          developing extensions to Rice University's HPCToolkit performance
          tools to support measurement and analysis of GPU-accelerated
          applications on current supercomputers based on NVIDIA GPUs and
          forthcoming exascale systems based on AMD and Intel GPUs. At present,
          HPCToolkit's support for NVIDIA's GPUs is the most mature. To help
          developers understand the performance of accelerated applications as a
          whole, HPCToolkit's measurement and analysis tools attribute metrics
          to calling contexts that span both CPUs and GPUs. HPCToolkit measures
          both profiles and traces of GPU execution. To measure GPU-accelerated
          applications efficiently, HPCToolkit employs novel wait-free data
          structures to coordinate monitoring and attribution of GPU performance
          metrics. To help developers understand the performance of complex GPU
          code generated from high-level template-based programming models,
          HPCToolkit's hpcprof constructs sophisticated approximations of call
          path profiles for GPU computations. To support fine-grain analysis and
          tuning, HPCToolkit uses platform-dependent hardware and software
          measurement capabilities to attribute GPU performance metrics to
          source lines and loops. We illustrate HPCToolkit's emerging
          capabilities for analyzing GPU-accelerated applications with several
          case studies.
